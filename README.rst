Deploy Notes
---------------------

Setup
---------------------

git remote add origin https://github.com/acutesoftware/aikif.com.git


Goals
---------------------
The core data tables (events, objects, facts, etc) should not be added to manually via the website, rather it should use mappers and programs to parse info into them.

Views / searches are then used to get useful results from those core data tables
